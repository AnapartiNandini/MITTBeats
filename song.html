        [Verse 1]
        There's a fire starting in my heart
        Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
        Finally, I can see you crystal clear
        Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
        See how I'll leave with every piece of you
        Don't underestimate the things that I will do
        There's a fire starting in my heart
        Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

        [Pre-Chorus]
        The scars of your love remind me of us
        They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
        The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
        I can't help feeling

        [Chorus]
        We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
        You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

        [Verse 2]
        Baby, I have no story to be told
        But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
        Think of me in the depths of your despair
        Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

        [Pre-Chorus]
        (You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love remind me of us
        (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
        (You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
        (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) I can't help feeling

        [Chorus]
        We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
        You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
        Could've had it all
        Rolling in the deep
        You had my heart inside of your hand
        But you played it with a beating

        [Bridge]
        Throw your soul through every open door (Ooh woah, oh)
        Count your blessings to find what you look for (Woah)
        Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Ooh woah, oh)
        You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

        [Breakdown]
        (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        We could've had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
        We could've had it all, yeah (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        It all, it all, it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

        [Chorus]
        We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
        You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
        Could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
        You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        But you played it, you played it, you played it
        You played it to the beat
